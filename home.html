		<h2>Larmor precession based neutron scattering techniques</h2>
		<p>
		The Larmor precession of neutrons in well defined magnetic fields was first used to measure inelastic neutron scattering at the ILL (Grenoble, France) during the 1970s. The use of the precessing neutron spin as an incredibly accurate "stopwatch" enables measurements to made of energy exchange, by a sample, with the scattered neutron as small as micro eV. This is achieved despite using high flux beams with no requirement for extreme monochromation or collimation. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Since this technique (Neutron Spin Echo (NSE)) was first demonstrated, numerous other experimental variants have been developed that use Larmor precession to encode either the energy of the neutron beam or the direction the neutron takes through the instrument. Each is optimised to measure different regions of either energy or q space.

			<li> Links to resources for further reading
			<li> Links to the facilties and instruments that perform the measurements
			<li> Contacts for further information
			<li> Updates on meetings, workshops, conferences and other items of general insterest to the community.
